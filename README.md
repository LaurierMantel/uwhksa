This is a prototype page for the UW Hong Kong Student Association at University of Waterloo. This is a way to promote students and individuals interested in the Hong Kong culture. We want to promote diverity in our amazing university.

This was forked from a previous implemention due to the original creator having moved on from the project and its stagnation.
